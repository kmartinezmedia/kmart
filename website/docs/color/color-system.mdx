title: The color system
---

CDS color primitive aligns with the Coinbase Brand refresh work and makes it easy to create accessible designs that can be light or dark.
Our color system is comprised of Spectrum, which is a robust color library, and Palettes, which is a subset of Spectrum geared towards aligning common usages across products.

## Accessibility

Every designer and engineer should uphold WCAG AA 2.1 accessibility standards. Using CDS, especially for color, gets you 90% of the way there!
