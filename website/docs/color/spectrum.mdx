Spectrum is an extensive color library with 8 color sets that has both light and dark mode versions.

- Spectrum was created based with the Brand team latest color work.
- Every color used in an interface should come from Spectrum.
- All color sets are generated by our algorithm that ensures a consistent color breakdown across the various color spaces.

Only use Spectrum directly when a color use case has not been covered by our palettes. Remember to test for color contrast accessibility in light & dark mode.

Nearly all of the CDS spectrum colors will auto-invert in dark mode. For example, gray100 in light mode is dark gray in light mode and will become white in dark mode, which ensures that dark text/icon colors in Light Mode will automatically become light in Dark mode.

Similarly, colors in light mode will invert automatically to a darker shade in dark mode that appears more muted, which helps prevent a vibration in the eye.
